# Flixage - Music streaming app

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) frontend app for my [project](https://github.com/ZbutwialyPiernik/flixage).

## Building and running

<<<<<<< HEAD
After pulling project for first time you won't be able to compile, you need to generate files for first time using

```
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

=======
>>>>>>> origin/master
If you're using enumlator and you host api server on same machine, then everything is ready at start.

```
flutter run
```

However if you're not running app on emulator then you should define address for api server, because default value is http://10.0.0.2:8080/api and it won't work on normal android phone.

```
flutter run --dart-define FLIXAGE_API_SERVER=[HERE YOUR ADDRESS]
```

## Important

There are few things to remember when working with this project, code generation does not handle generics properly and non-primitive types, after generating project you will have few problems with code.

1. In track by default Duration is deserialized by microseconds, not miliseconds like in API.
2. Due to problems with generics you need to give reference to deserializing method (Json generator is not able to deduce type), example is SearchResponse class.

```
// you need to add this manually                              \/
final value = PageResponse<Track>.fromJson(_result.data, Track.fromJson);
```

## TODO

- Refactor views and extract widgets to custom classes/methods to improve readability
- Internationalize strings in app âœ… (90% done)
- Benchmark app and improve performance
