# Flixage

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) frontend app for my [project](https://github.com/ZbutwialyPiernik/flixage) done in Spring Boot.

## TODO

- Refactor views and extract widgets to custom classes/methods to improve readability
- Internationalize strings in app
- Create custom music player library/create pull request to existing to support custom HTTP headers. Not single one supports them yet.
