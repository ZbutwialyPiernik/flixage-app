# Flixage - Music streaming app

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) frontend app for my [project](https://github.com/ZbutwialyPiernik/flixage).

## Building and running

If you're using enumlator and you host api server on same machine, then everything is ready at start.

```
flutter run
```

However if you're not running app on emulator then you should define address for api server, because default value is http://10.0.0.2:8080/api and it won't work on normal android phone.

```
flutter run --dart-define FLIXAGE_API_SERVER=[HERE YOUR ADDRESS]
```

## Important

There are few things to remember when working with this project, after generating code with _pub_ you will have one problem with generics. You need to give reference to deserializing method (Json generator is not able to deduce type), example is SearchResponse class.

```
// you need to add this manually                              \/
final value = PageResponse<Track>.fromJson(_result.data, Track.fromJson);
```

## TODO

- Refactor views and extract widgets to custom classes/methods to improve readability
- Internationalize strings in app âœ… (90% done)
- Benchmark app and improve performance
